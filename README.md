##Py City Schools##
Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. Schools with higher spending per student actually (\\$645-\\675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<\\$585 per student).
Overall, smaller and medium sized schools performed better than large sized schools (both on reading and math passing rate)
Charter schools had better passing rates than public district schools both on reading and math.
The additional query shows that all charter schools (regardless of size) performed better than the public distric schools (that were all large size schools).
Additional analysis is required, as the school sample is very small.
